# Rock_Paper_Scissors

//this is my version of ROCK SCISSORS PAPER
//note: my written english is realy poor so i'm sorry in advance this is not my main language
//many things i did may not be the most efficent way to do this project but for now is my best shot

this code is suppose to show my attempt at doing a rock paper scissors game shown in the console
for the odin project

i added some css just to put some dark back ground to prevent eye burning


update:did use event lissener to put a UI to the game
